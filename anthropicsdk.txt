Getting started with the OpenAI SDK
To use the OpenAI SDK compatibility feature, you’ll need to:

Use an official OpenAI SDK
Change the following
Update your base URL to point to Anthropic’s API
Replace your API key with an Anthropic API key
Update your model name to use a Claude model
Review the documentation below for what features are supported
​
Quick start example

Python

TypeScript

import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",   // Your Anthropic API key
    baseURL: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/",  // Anthropic API endpoint
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "Who are you?" }
    ],
    model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", // Claude model name
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
​
Important OpenAI compatibility limitations
​
API behavior
Here are the most substantial differences from using OpenAI:

The strict parameter for function calling is ignored, which means the tool use JSON is not guaranteed to follow the supplied schema.
Audio input is not supported; it will simply be ignored and stripped from input
Prompt caching is not supported, but it is supported in the Anthropic SDK
System/developer messages are hoisted and concatenated to the beginning of the conversation, as Anthropic only supports a single initial system message.
Most unsupported fields are silently ignored rather than producing errors. These are all documented below.
